# MakeUC_TeamTrojanWave
Hackathon project using EchoAR

During University of Cincinnati's MakeUC 2020 this project was created to explore EchoAR, and its console along with Unity.
The project attempted to create an image and video gallery in AR which showed COVID19 guidelines as relevant according to location or the image.
